PROJECT REPORT 

1. Introduction
   
The Learning App is a mobile application developed using Kotlin in Android Studio.
It is designed to offer a simple experience using true/false questions.
The app aims to enhance users' general knowledge and learning through a series of true/false questions.
This report outlines the design, development, implementation, and features of the learning App.

2. Objectives

‚Ä¢ Develop a functional and user-friendly quiz application.

‚Ä¢ Provide immediate feedback to the user based on their answers.

‚Ä¢ Keep track of the score and present it at the end of the quiz.

‚Ä¢ Offer users the ability to review their answers.

‚Ä¢ Ensure smooth navigation between screens and logical flow.

3. Tools and Technologies Used

‚Ä¢ Programming Language: Kotlin

‚Ä¢ Development Environment: Android Studio

‚Ä¢ Minimum SDK: Android 5.0 (API 21)

‚Ä¢ Layout Files: XML for UI design

4. System Design and Architecture
   
4.1 Activities Overview

‚Ä¢ MainActivity: Displays a welcome screen with a description and a 'Start' button.

‚Ä¢ questionPage: Handles question presentation, answer selection, feedback, and score calculation.

‚Ä¢ scorePage: Displays the final score and gives options to review or exit.

4.2 Data Flow

‚Ä¢ The app starts in MainActivity.

‚Ä¢ Clicking 'Start' transitions to questionPage.

‚Ä¢ Questions and answers are stored in arrays.

‚Ä¢ User selections are processed and score is calculated.

‚Ä¢ After the last question, the score and data are passed to scorePage.

‚Ä¢ User can review their performance or exit the application.

5. Implementation Details
   
5.1 Question and Answer Logic

Questions are stored as an array of strings and their corresponding answers as a boolean array.
User selections are checked against the correct answers and feedback is displayed immediately.

5.2 Disabling Buttons

Once a user selects either 'True' or 'False', both buttons are disabled to prevent answer changes.
This ensures each question can only be answered once.

5.3 Score Calculation

A score variable keeps track of the number of correct answers.
At the end of all questions, this score is displayed with a performance message.

5.4 Review Feature

The review option on the score screen allows users to see all the questions along with the correct answers, helping them learn from any mistakes.

6. Screenshots
   
Screenshots of the application can be added here for each screen: Welcome, Questions, Score.

7. Testing and Evaluation
   
The application was tested on an Android emulator and physical device. 
It successfully handled transitions between activities, user inputs, score calculation, and review functionality
No major bugs were found, and the app performs reliably with a responsive UI.

8. Conclusion
    
The learning App meets its objective of providing a simple and educational quiz experience.
Through the use of Kotlin and Android Studio, the application demonstrates fundamental mobile development practices, UI management, and user interaction handling.

9. Future Enhancements
    
‚Ä¢ Add more questions and categories.
